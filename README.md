# NodeJS Demos with Databases
Some examples of using NodeJs with databases

## Express JS with MongoDb
This is based on someone elses example, with some minor changes where things didn't seem to work as expected. For example, I didn't bother with CSS, and the instructions on the web page were not always clear, but the GitHub repo clarified things.
https://github.com/zellwk/crud-demo which points to example instructions at https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb 

I also found it useful to look at the MongoDB driver documentation for NodeJS at https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/current/quick-start/
